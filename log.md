# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 24. September, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Worked on a imdb-python-script. Script is working with a few bugs for tomorrow

**Thoughts:** I just hope that imdb.com is not banning me for excessive access on here site :D and i need to learn, how to create xls-files in python

**Link to work:** See Folder Day 1

### Day 1: 25. September, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Worked again on the imdb-python-script. The script now creates the excel-file itself. Next stop, removing of hardcoded id's

**Thoughts:** The creating of excel-files is pretty easy. Maybe useful to now for later. And i really need to clean up that script.

### Day 2: 26. September, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Finished working on the imdb-script. Added some useful cmd-parameter and done some refactoring.

**Thoughts:** Refactoring was good. Still missing the error handling. Maybe later. Probably not tomorrow
